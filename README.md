## Caveats

It should be explicitly noted that if a vendor name does not appear on this list, it
should not be used as the sole indicator of the legitimacy of that vendor. There are
many companies out there that are perfectly viable and trustworthy, and simply have
not come across this directory yet, or choose not to be listed. This directory should
only serve as a single point of measurement in your research of a particular vendor.
It is not intended to be the single source of truth, nor would we ever make that claim.
